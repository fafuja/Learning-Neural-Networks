*Superised Learning = refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the "right asnwers" were given. (i.e. we gave a data set in which for every example in this data set, we told it what is the right choice).

*Supervised Learning problems can be categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.(Regression -> continuous valued output / Classification -> Discrete valued output)

-> Example 1:
Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market, try to predict their price.Price as a function of size is a continuous output, so this is a regression problem.

We could turn this example into a classification problem by instead making our output about whether the house "sells for more or less than the asking price". Here we are classifying the houses based on price into two discrete categories.i

-> Example 2: 
Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture. (Regression)

Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or bening.

*Unsupervised Learning = Allow us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

*We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.

*With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

-> Example:

Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. indetifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sound a at a cocktail party.)
